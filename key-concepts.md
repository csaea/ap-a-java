# Concepts in Object-Oriented Programming

- **Class**  
  Implementation (like a blueprint or a factory) of attributes and behaviors of an object.

- **Object**  
  An instance of a class.

- **Attributes**  
  Data related to a class, stored in variables.

- **Behaviors**  
  What instances of a class can *do*.

- **Constructor**  
  A special method used to create and initialize a new object.

- **Separation of Concerns**  
  Keeping different parts of a program focused on their own tasks, so code is easier to manage.

- **Package**  
  A way to group related classes together, like folders for your code.

- **Encapsulation**  
  Hiding details inside a class and only showing what is necessary, usually with `private` and `public`.
